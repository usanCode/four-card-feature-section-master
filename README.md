## Welcome!!

For this project, at first, I have tought to implement 2 main containers: 
one for the headings and the main text and, a second one for the tables.
for the first container, I have chosen to use "Flex" for the display's property
and "grid" for the second container.
Looking at the design models given for this project, I have noticed the texts of the first container 
have to be put in the middle of the body while for the mobile design, the headings, 
main text and tables are like to be displayed in the same column.
Then, I changed my mind and came back to my first idea of implementing 2 grid-containers.
Therefore, for the first container, I have choosen "grid" as value for the display property.
Another issue I found tricky is that the two sentences of the heading had to have the same width.
